# Photo galleries

Each event can have a photo manifest at:

`assets/photos/<eventId>/manifest.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "eventId": "cookie-2094-dec-2025",
  "photos": [
    {
      "src": "assets/photos/cookie-2094-dec-2025/1700000000_1_ab12cd.jpg",
      "alt": "",
      "uploadedAt": "2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can create/update this via `admin/` (the GitHub uploader) or by committing files directly.
